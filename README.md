PROBLEM:
#
  Using ML, a model can be trained to predict the likelihood that non-cis male students will join the football squad in the
upcoming college season. The management of the college, in particular the sports department, can use this information to develop strategies that
will effectively motivate non-cis male students to engage in sports and advance gender variety in the college's sports
programs.

DESCRIPTION:
#
By gathering the Ashoka Premier League 5.0 and 6.0 dataset, we can predict the participation of non-cis male students
in the college's football team based on a number of features, including the cost of the non-cis players (by comparing
with the cost of the male players and their differences), batchwise-analysis (how many non-cis male players from each
batch are there), in one tier- how many non-cis males are there compared to men proportion, etc.
